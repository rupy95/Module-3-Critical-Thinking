# Module 3 Critical Thinking Assignment

This repository contains the solution for the **Module 3 Critical Thinking Assignment** from CSC450. The task involves creating a C++ program to demonstrate the use of integer pointers and dynamic memory allocation.

## Assignment Overview

### Objective
The objective of this program is to:
- Accept three integer inputs from the user.
- Store these values in variables and use integer pointers to allocate dynamic memory for them.
- Display the values and their memory addresses.
- Deallocate the memory properly to avoid memory leaks.

### Program Features
- Dynamically allocated memory using `new` operator.
- Proper memory management with `delete` operator.
- Output includes values of integers and their respective memory addresses.
